# Personalized Customer Recommendation System

This repository contains a highly advanced, production-ready personalized recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning techniques, and is designed to scale with cloud infrastructure using AWS for real-time recommendations.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering**: Combines user-product interactions and metadata for personalized recommendations.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values, normalization, and feature extraction from raw data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes grid search to find the optimal parameters for the deep learning model.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Stores and retrieves datasets from AWS S3 for large-scale data processing.
- **Dockerized Application**: Runs in a containerized environment using Docker for easy deployment.
- **Real-time Recommendation System**: Processes new user data in real-time for instant recommendations.

## System Architecture

1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic data generation to simulate a large-scale e-commerce platform.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and transformation for collaborative filtering.
3. **Model Training**: Deep learning models for personalized recommendations using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. **Evaluation**: Model evaluation and tuning using hyperparameter optimization and A/B testing.
5. **Real-time Processing**: Integrated with AWS S3 for cloud storage and real-time recommendation processing.
